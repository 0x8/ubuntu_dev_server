# Ubuntu Dev Server Setup

This script exists to set up a minimal, graphical instance of Ubuntu Server (18.04)
that utilizes the i3-gaps desktop environment and the lightdm desktop manager. It
features a lot of the utilities and programs that I tend to use most often as well
as variations of my dotfiles tweaked for this particular use case.

While not everyone will use everything I download with this script, hopefully this
script helps someone out looking to quickly set up their system.
